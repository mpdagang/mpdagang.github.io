    <h2>John 16:32-33</h2>
    <p><q>The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be 
    scattered, each one to his home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I 
    am not alone because the Father is with me. I have said this to you, 
    so that in me you may have peace. In the world you face persecution. 
    But take courage; I have conquered the world!</q></p>

    <h2>Matthew 6:5-6</h2>
    <p><q>...whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray 
    to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret 
    will reward you.</q></p>

    <h2>Matthew 7:3-5</h2>
    <p><q>Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and 
    pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to 
    your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the 
    time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the 
    plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the 
    speck from your brother’s eye.</q></p>

    <h2>Matthew 25:34-36,40</h2>
    <p><q>Then the king will say to those at his right hand, ‘Come, you
    that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you 
    from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me 
    food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a 
    stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, 
    I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.
    Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who 
    are members of my family, you did it to me.’...</q></p>
