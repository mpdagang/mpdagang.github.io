<h2>John 16:32-33</h2>
<p><q>The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be 
scattered, each one to his home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I 
am not alone because the Father is with me. I have said this to you, 
so that in me you may have peace. In the world you face persecution. 
But take courage; I have conquered the world!</q></p>

<h2>Matthew 6:5-6</h2>
<p><q>...whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray 
to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret 
will reward you.</q></p>

<h2>Matthew 7:3-5</h2>
<p><q>Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and 
pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to 
your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the 
time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the 
plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the 
speck from your brother’s eye.</q></p>
