    <blockquote class="mp-pry-quote">
      <p>In the treasuries of wisdom are wise sayings, but godliness 
        is an abomination to a sinner. If you desire wisdom, keep the 
        commandments, and the Lord will supply it for you. For the fear 
        of the Lord is wisdom and instruction, and he delights in fidelity 
        and meekness.</p>
        <p>— Sirach 1:25-27</p>

    <blockquote class="mp-pry-quote">
      <p>For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird; but these 
        men lie in wait for their own blood, they set an ambush for their
        own lives. Such are the ways of all who get gain by violence;
        it takes away the life of its possessors</p>
      <p>— Proverbs 1:17-19</p>

    <blockquote class="mp-pry-quote">
      <p>Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you 
        will eat or what you will drink, or about your body, what you 
        will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than 
        clothing? ...and indeed your heavenly Father knows that you 
        need all these things. But strive first for the kingdom of 
        God and his righteousness, and all these things will be given 
        to you as well.</p>
      <p>So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring 
        worries of its own. Today’s trouble is enough for today.</p>
      <p>— Matthew 6:25,32-34</p>

    <blockquote class="mp-pry-quote">
      <p>Then he shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
      Those who were in front sternly ordered him to be quiet; but he 
      shouted even more loudly, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” 
      Jesus stood still and ordered the man to be brought to him; and 
      when he came near, he asked him, </p>
      <p>“What do you want me to do for you?” He said, “Lord, let me 
      see again.” Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your 
      faith has saved you.” Immediately he regained his sight and 
      followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw 
      it, praised God.

    <blockquote class="mp-pry-quote">
      <p>I will praise you, Lord. Although you were angry with me, your 
      anger has turned away and you have comforted me. Surely God is my 
      salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. The Lord, the Lord 
      himself, is my strength and my defense; he has become my salvation.
      With joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation.</p>
      <p>— Isaiah 12:1-3</p>

    <blockquote class="mp-pry-quote">
      <p>“The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you will be 
      scattered, each one to his home, and you will leave me alone. Yet I 
      am not alone because the Father is with me. I have said this to you, 
      so that in me you may have peace. In the world you face persecution. 
      But take courage; I have conquered the world!”</p>
      <p>— John 16:32-33</p>

      <p>“Whenever you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray 
      to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret 
      will reward you.”</p>
      <p>— Matthew 6:5-6</p>

    <blockquote class="mp-pry-quote">
      <p>Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and 
      pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to 
      your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the 
      time there is a plank in your own eye? 5 You hypocrite, first take the 
      plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the 
      speck from your brother’s eye.</p>
      <p>— Matthew 7:3-5</p>

    <blockquote class="mp-pry-quote">
      <p>Then the king will say to those at his right hand, ‘Come, you
      that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you 
      from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me 
      food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a 
      stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, 
      I was sick and you took care of me, I was in prison and you visited me.
      Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who 
      are members of my family, you did it to me.’...</p>
      <p>— Matthew 25:34-36,40</p>
