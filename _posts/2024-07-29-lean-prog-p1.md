Bloated codes are messy.

With the right knowledge of of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, one can create a 
powerful website even if it is static and has no huge codebase or database backing it up.

It's quite liberating to make too knowing that you're less likely to face issues with 
dependencies and untested code. Of course these complex libraries and frameworks are not 
without their merits, but it's also good to step back and think before using them: do I 
really need this much bloated software?

- The [original](https://berthub.eu/articles/LeanSoftware_text.pdf){: .b-link } plea.

Of course, to do lean means to know what bloat is.
