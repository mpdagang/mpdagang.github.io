Looking into the power of CSS linear()

After experimenting with svg paths and 3d css, it's time to put some bounce in it.
The [linear function](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/css-ui/css-linear-easing-function) 
allows us to do complex animations that were once only possible' in js.

One of my favorite use of this reside in CSS wrapped 2024 [intro](https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2024/#introduction)
when you hover on the categories.
