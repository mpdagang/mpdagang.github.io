Finding sites using this ssg sparks joy.

I've learned long before [Alex Chan's site](https://alexwlchan.net/about-the-site/){: .b-link } was made with 
Jekyll. After researching for Ruby on Rails, I then stumbled upon
Yoko Harada's (yokolet) [website](https://yokolet.com/about/){: .b-link }. Just recently, and
I can't believe I'm just knowing this now, Jan Wildeboer's [web home](https://jan.wildeboer.net/2023/02/Jekyll-Mastodon-Comments/){: .b-link } is also Jekyll under the hood. There was also a stirr about a
certain [Ai post](https://anthonymoser.github.io/writing/ai/haterdom/2025/08/26/i-am-an-ai-hater.html){: .b-link } by Anthony Moser, another Jekyll site. 

When I decided to create a personal site I was lead to believe that I
need to go big or go _latest_ with the frameworks and fancy tech. Turns
out all I needed was what I started with. And a lot of people in the web
still use it after all.
