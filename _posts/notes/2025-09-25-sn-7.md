_Git Gud_ with a newly added cheat sheet.

A few days ago Julia Evans [contributed](https://github.com/git/git-scm.com/pull/2049/){: .b-link }
a new [cheat sheet](https://git-scm.com/cheat-sheet){: .b-link } at the git website. Funny how there's a multitude of cheat
sheets out there, including Evan's, but only now did git-scm gain
its own. I like their discussion at the pull request at the repo where
they tackle the design and size considerations. _Developers putting 
the priority for users_ in action.

Julia is also making other changes to make the git docs much more 
readable. Keeping an eye out for [the updates](https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/115211009849526802){: .b-link }.
