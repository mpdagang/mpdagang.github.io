Learn and relearn making in the web.

A few weeks ago Dr. Alex started a blog series, _Learning Web Development_.
It's a great refresher even for experienced devs IMO so go [check it out](https://2ality.com/2025/08/learning-web-dev-toc.html){: .b-link } (being updated as of writing).

I personally like the build up of the lessons as it approached the _Using web servers_ part. He eases you in to the terms and concepts on the the foundations
of the web, get's you up to speed with urls, protocols, the works.
