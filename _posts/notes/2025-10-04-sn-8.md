Finally! PHP foundation [heard and responded](https://thephp.foundation/blog/2025/10/01/design-contest/){: .b-link } 
to calls for redesinging the docs site of PHP, starting with the v8.5 release page.

Maybe something like git's or Ruby's or Laravel's? Modern but not too
razzle dazzle. But one thing I absolutely hope is that the people 
invested in this doesn't come with Tailwind-riddled suggestions.
