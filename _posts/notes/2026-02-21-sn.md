title: Animation in the way

Rambling right now about how web animation is used to overbeautify or present itself as
a sort of innovation while totally missing the point. This lead me to thinking:

> Animation should lead the way, not get in the way.

If your animation isn't at the very least expressive or with intent and is disrupting
the flow-state of your site visitor's attention or accessibility, don't.

One more thing. It's a good practice I think to review how animators morph an 
object to another kind using a [snappy switch](){: .b-link} or a 
[stretchy natural technique](){: .b-link} to implement better looking, 
non-dissociating view transitions.
