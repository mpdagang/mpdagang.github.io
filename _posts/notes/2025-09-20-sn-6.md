A native way to include site fragments.

Declarative partial updates (calling it DPU for now) is a transclution 
method using a html native element instead of relying on server-side code. 
Imagine a `<fragment>` tag that calls a header.html file like so:

```html
<fragment src="parts/header.html">
...
</fragment>
```

It's an HTML native way of doing an `include` like in PHP. Introducing 
such a feature opens up multiple questions. Here's some from the discussion
I read at [github](https://github.com/WICG/proposals/issues/216){: .b-link }:
1. how to style fragments?
2. how to reference files (css/js), fragments local directory or the
   calling html file's directory?

Keeping track of the progess at [the WICG repo](https://github.com/WICG/declarative-partial-updates){: .b-link }.
