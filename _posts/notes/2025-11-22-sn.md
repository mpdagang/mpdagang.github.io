In a [digital encounter event](https://youtu.be/tHSWW-c-fHM?si=rnjMPAbK4YS7PDtk){: .b-link},
Pope Leo tells how Ai can never replace the unique gift that is all of Us.

>Ai can process information quickly, but it cannot replace human
intelligence. And don't ask it to do your homework for you. It cannot
offer real wisdom. It misses a very important human element. Ai will not
judge between what is truly right and what is wrong, and it won't stand
in authentic wonder, before the beauty, the beauty of God's creation.

There really isn't any reasoning going on, just extensively backed 
statistics. And Ai doesn't really think, but [we do](https://www.craigabbott.co.uk/blog/ai-doesnt-need-to-think-we-do/){: .b-link}.
We need to hone that skill.

>So be prudent, be wise. Be careful that your use of Ai does not limit
your true human growth. Use it in such a way that if it disappeared
tomorrow, you would still know how to think, how to create, how to act 
on your own, how to form authentic friendship.

This is what deeply worries me. Without proper supervision, students
might mistake overeliance on Ai tools to [produce results as a _success_](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/history-professor-ai-cheating-students_n_69178150e4b0781acfd62540){: .b-link}.
The true success is the journey towards the output. At best, LLM tools
should assist students, not slop out finished products for them.

>Remember, Ai can never replace that unique gift that you are to the world.

Each of us is a gift. And if the tech bros can't see that or willfully
go about their day despite the fact, then, like King Antiochus, 
they've secured their demise.
