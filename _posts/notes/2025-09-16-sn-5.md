Big help from small tools.

As the name suggests, [bookmarklets](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarklets-perform-common-web-page-tasks){: .b-link }  are small javascript functions you can add to your browser's bookmark bar. Clicking them triggers their functionality.

Here are some bookmarklets I've encountered:
- [2Vid](https://www.phpied.com/capturing-web-page-video-with-a-couple-of-bookmarklets/){: .b-link }, allows you to screen record browser and saves it into a file.
- Just recently, a [_More_ opener](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2025/09/14/bookmarklet-load-all-github-comments-take-2/){: .b-link } 
  for Github and [text-fragment link](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/text-fragments-bookmarklet/){: .b-link } generator.
