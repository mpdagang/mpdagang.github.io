Imagine that brick game where you drive an 8-brick F1 car whizzing 
left to right to avoid obstacles, but do it with characters. [Loser lane](https://marieflanagan.com/loserlane/){: .b-link}
is a game made by [Marie Flanagan](https://marieflanagan.com/){: .b-link} where you control a bike user to avoid obstacles on the bike
lane. This has a special place in my heart because of the advocacy
of active mobility merried with programming. I felt the same when I encountered a [frogger-like game](https://onelinergames.com/games/i35frogger/webversion/){: .b-link} 
made by advocates against road widening.

Recent flood control issues, among other important things, impeded
our transportation to a halt. It's ripe for a similar game.
