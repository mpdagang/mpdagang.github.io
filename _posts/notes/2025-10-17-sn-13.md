What does [Florian's](https://florianziegler.com/){: .b-link}, [Andre's](https://andre.arko.net/){: .b-link}, 
[Drapper's](https://joel.drapper.me/){: .b-link}, [Aleksandr's](){: .b-link}, [Geerling's](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/){: .b-link}, 
[Vasilis'](https://vasilis.nl/nerd/){: .b-link}, [Hojberg's](https://hojberg.xyz/the-programmer-identity-crisis/){: .b-link},

Taking note of these here because I'm just amazed how simple yet 
proffesional these sites feel even if the design and theme uses mainly 
black and white. 

Oh, and there's also Pickering and Bell's website for [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/){: .b-link}, a book on making better and resilient CSS, dawning black and
white. Beyond the colors, you can see the intentions in spacing, layout
and identity commanded by the site; an algorithmic layout design is at
play.
