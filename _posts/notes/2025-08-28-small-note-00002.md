Leaving corporate socials is a Choice. 

Many say it's hard, including me. But it might not be the case... 

> But, as someone who dumped social media many years ago, let me tell you: it’s not that hard. Life will continue just fine. It will probably feel strange for a week or two, and then your brain will adapt, and everything is gonna be ok. Sure, you’ll probably miss a few completely pointless updates from family and friends. That’s ok. That’s fine. Humanity has worked that way for most of its existence, and we’re still here, chugging along. - [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/you-will-not-believe-what-i-just-wrote)

> For a long time, I fell into a trap of feeling like I needed to be online all the time. I needed to consume all the bad news to stay informed. This is a trap. We are not meant to consume the amount of content we do. It’s paralyzing.
The smallest act of resistance you can do right now is unplug. - [Stephanie Stimac](https://blog.stephaniestimac.com/posts/2025/08/social-media-detox/)

> I deleted the apps from my phone to prevent the muscle memory of opening them, but when they weren’t there, I just didn’t really think about them. There’s only so much Discourse my simple brain can handle and I should only be dealing with that during work hours as I see it. - [Andy Bell](https://bell.bz/i-deleted-bluesky-mastodon-and-linkedin-off-my-phone/)
