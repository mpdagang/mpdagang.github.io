Alex hits it home with [when using to-the-point, no fuss device](https://thatalexguy.dev/posts/writing-post-palm-pilot/){: .b-link}
and software from days of tech old. 

>The Palm Pilot is from an era where boutique software developers 
crafted applications to provide value, rather than stick you with 
another subscription fee. Shareware on the Palm was a pay once ordeal, 
and for that you typically got exactly what you expected. No ads, 
tracking, internet requirement or bloat.

Surely we can re-establish this era when software and devices weren't
[as needy as they are now](https://tonsky.me/blog/needy-programs/#updates){: .b-link}, right?

All this reminiscing fires me up to repurpose my Sony phones, listen 
more to self, non algorithmically currated music on my PSP, revive my 
offline MP4, and, heck, even install new OS on my aged Toshiba. Why not?
