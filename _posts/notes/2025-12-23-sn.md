It is my strong belief that there's no reason why Thinkpad form-factored [lapdocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapdock){: .b-link} shouldn't exist.
It's a criminal offense not to make one now with existence of overpowered
handheld devices running some form of Linux under the hood.

Can't we have smartphones slide into Thinkpad [701Cs](https://blog.jgc.org/2023/12/restoration-of-ibm-thinkpad-701c.html){: .b-link} or [220s](https://justanotherelectronicsblog.com/?p=1331){: .b-link} lapdocks
in 2026, maybe? Would happily spend whatever for such a device just to 
squeeze some actual usefulness from a laptop affordance!
