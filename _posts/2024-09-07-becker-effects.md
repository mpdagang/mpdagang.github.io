Animation vs Web Programming

<div class="mp-l-grid-2">
  <p>Perhaps you're familiar with Alan Becker? He's the guy behind a famous series Animations vs. 
     Animator where the protagonists are stick figures. Stories revolve around a premise of they vs them 
     in visual and engaging 2D fight scenes with little to no dialogue.</p>

## Animation vs Geometry
An ongoing series they've done revolves around Education. Imagine stick figures fighting Math and
equations! The latest installment focused on [Geometry](https://youtu.be/VEJWE6cpqw0?si=TghGczFcpZTRPbdq){: .b-link } and they've created multiple animation styles
that kind of translate to CSS thus the creation of this post study. Above is a drawing of _The Second Coming_
done using pure css. What to draw/animate next?
