title: WebGL Thoughts

Pondering on what is the goal for learning WebGL as a Software Developer.

There is currently an idea at the back of my mind to make interactive 
models of Manila footbridges where users can visit a website, pan and rotate
the model. 

The main goal is to show how the footbridge layout affects people how it
integrates in its environment.
